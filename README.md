# ImageProcessor

This project contains python scripts for PCI Geomatica algorithms and processes.

## Usage

To run this script for Landsat8 satellite imagery, place the input files into ./landsat/input. Then
execute the script. The output shape files will be placed into ./landsat/output.
It is recommended to open a command prompt window, navigate to the /imageProcessor folder and to 
execute the script using: 

`python imageProcessor.python`

By using a command prompt, the processing comments and times will be visible in the console, making 
the process easier to follow.
